# Blockchain-for-proptech

This project was realised in my third year at HE-ARC Neuchatel.
It is an Ethereum base real estate manager with the possibility to rent the property.
The smart contracte are coded in Solidity using the Truffle suit and there is a web3 frontend to interract with them.

To launch the project, you must use ganache to run a local ethereum blockchain, liteserver to load the frontend in your browser with metamask to send the transactions.
